# CT40XX - Week X - Tutorial
Welcome to your second Tutorial Repository for CT40XX Introduction to Artificial Intelligence! This is your own personal repository where you and only you can see and make changes.

We will be using GitHub Classrooms for most tutorials and Assignment submissions during this module, so it might be a good idea to brush up on your Git skills in your independant learning hours.

Below are a list of tutorials, these are not assessed but you are expected to complete each of them either in the practical session of the lecture or in your own time, they may seem simple, but they focus on building your skills from the ground up and will teach you the skills which the Assignments for this module are marked upon.

This weeks tutorials will show you how to run Python code outside of Jupyter Notebook alongside some Python Exercises to test your knowledge from today's session.
