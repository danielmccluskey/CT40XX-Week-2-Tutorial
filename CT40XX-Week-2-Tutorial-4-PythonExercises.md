# Python Exercises
Inside of the `TutorialFiles/PythonExercises` directory in this repository you will find a Jupyter Notebook file called `CT40XX-Week2-Tutorial.ipynb`.

Open this file in Jupyter Notebook (Which we we learned how to do last week!) and complete the exercises. If you get stuck, remember you can ask your fellow students or Module tutors during the session for help! There is nothing wrong with using Google either!
